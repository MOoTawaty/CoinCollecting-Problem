# CoinCollecting-Problem


This is a classic Dynamic Programming question where there is a (row x column) board which has coin placed on some of the squares. 
A robot travels from the upper left corner to the bottom right corner collecting coins. 
The robot can only move from left to right or from top to down at a time. 
You have to find the maximum number of coins picked up by the robot and also print that particular path on which robot collects that max number of coins.
